- I am a 22-year-old undegraduate in applied mathematics at [IMECC](https://www.ime.unicamp.br) - [Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/).
- My research interests broadly optimization, operations research, functional analysis, matrix computations and radiotherapy.
- Currently, I endeavor to improve and automate treatment planning for radiotherapy.
