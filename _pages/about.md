- I am PhD student in Operations Research at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) supervised by Prof. [Timothy C.Y. Chan](https://chan.mie.utoronto.ca/).
- My interests are in theoretical aspects of mathematical optimization and its applications in healthcare.
- In the past, I have worked on improving and automating treatment planning for external beam radiotherapy.
- Currently, I am studying the magnet design problem. The goal is to generalize the theory of magnet design 
to accomodate arbitrarily complex magnetic fields. This way, magnets for MRI-LINACS systems can be designed
optimally for the first time.
