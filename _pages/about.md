- I am PhD student in Operations Research at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) supervised by Prof. [Timothy C.Y. Chan](https://chan.mie.utoronto.ca/).
- My research interests include optimization, matrix computations, and radiotherapy planning.
- Currently, I endeavor to improve and automate treatment planning for external beam radiotherapy.
