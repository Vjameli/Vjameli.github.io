- I am a 22-year-old undegraduate applied mathematician student at [IMECC](https://www.ime.unicamp.br) - [Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/).
- My research interests broadly cover optimization, operation research, functional analysis, matrix computations and radiotherapy.
- Currently, my endeavors lie on improving and automating treatment planning for radiotherapy.
Quoting the motto from Sebastiaan Breedveld: 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <q> <i>Each patient should receive the best treatment technically possible: not the best we could achieve.</i></q>
</div>
