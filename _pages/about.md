- I am a 23-year-old undergraduate in applied mathematics at [IMECC](https://www.ime.unicamp.br) - [Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/).
- My research interests broadly optimization, operation research, matrix computations and radiotherapy.
- Currently, I endeavor to improve and automate treatment planning for radiotherapy.
