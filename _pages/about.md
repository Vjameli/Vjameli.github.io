- I am a 23-year-old undergraduate finishing my major in applied mathematics at [IMECC](https://www.ime.unicamp.br) - [Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/).
- My research interests broadly covers optimization, operation research, matrix computations, and radiotherapy planning.
- Currently, I endeavor to improve and automate treatment planning for external beam radiotherapy.
